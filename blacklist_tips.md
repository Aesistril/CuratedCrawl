# Popular sites
To create a great blacklist table, I recommend importing the whole [https://www.domcop.com/top-10-million-websites](top 10 million websites) list and fine tuning it till it's ok

# Sites to not blacklist
If you have imported the whole 10 mil sites list into the database, I recommend dropping these sites which can contain retro stuff
- crimew.gay
- neocities.org
... list may grow larger
